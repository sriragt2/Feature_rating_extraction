0,"This lens works very nice for portrait shoots. Gives a very nice detailed subject shot with nice blurred background!  the results from this lens impressed me the first time I used it on the camera,  I paired it up with a canon rebel EOS T6S and  on viewing the photos on the computer even at 100% all I could say was WOW!  Detail and sharpness was incredible. For the money $120.00 or a little less this one is a great investment.  Only negative I found is that it is a little noisy on focusing for a STM compared to some of the others but the picture quality and quickness to focus still make it a great lens to own. The image quality more than makes up for this.Read full review...",positive
1,"I just purchased my first camera and from what I’d gathered the starter lens was good for family functions and such, but for better quality I was advised to start with this lens. I LOVE IT! My pictures are coming out beautifully and I really love the 1.8 aperture. I don’t think that I’ll ever take it off (before I upgrade to whatever is next). I’m completely in love with this jewel. Images are sharp, crisp, and clean! I’m so glad to have started with this lens instead of waiting. I hope this helps someone decide. It’s definitely worth the reasonable cost.Read full review...",positive
2,"This lense is excellent value for the money. I have a crop sensor camera (70d) so this lense is equivalent to about 80mm which is a good focal point for portraits. This lense however might not be ideal for taking pictures indoors as you'll find yourself having to back up a bit. It's fairly sharp wide open and very sharp when you stop it down a bit. The build quality is ok it has a metal mount which I like which is a great improvement upon the old ""nifty-fifty"". I can't complain about this lense really, it's great value for the money especially if you're on a budget.Read full review...",positive
3,Really impressed on the clarity and focus of the lense. Very nice and sharp pictures taken right out of the box. Surprised how much of a difference it makes. It would be nice to have a bit more options as mm goes in one lense but I guess thats the photographer life. We do have the 18-55mm by canon as well and it does really good for a lot of things. This 50mm does 50mm extremely well.Read full review...,positive
4,"This is a great little prime lens. Great for close up shots.Very nice bokeh, much better than kit lens.Great video, with decent auto focus.Cons:very zoom in image. That makes it difficult to be versatile with this lens attached.Also the motor makes noise when changing focus.And when moving around taking videos you have to be careful to monitor the image because this lens does not auto focus as fast as some lenses do.Read full review...",positive
5,"I bought this prime hoping for better low light and better bokeh than the kit lens. Both are true, but I found I have to stop down to a smaller aperture to get a useful depth of field and clear focus at close range. So, there is still no substitute for practice and skill :) it is very light weight for travel, which is my primary use.Read full review...",positive
6,"Super sharp prime lens.  80mm equivalent on ASP-C camera.  Ideal focal length for portraits on ASP-C camera.  Small and light, I take it with me everywhere along with my EF-S 24mm f2.8 STM pancake lens (38mm equivalent on ASP-C).  The two lenses make a great pair for everyday use.  Small, light and quiet.Read full review...",positive
7,"I'm really loving this lens so far. I'm getting more into street photography and wanted to get my 6D down to a nice small size to be more on the go when traveling or walking the cities.It feels so pure and free not having to worry about zoom and having a fixed point to work with while shooting in the moment. This lens is super lightweight and small, and very sharp. Also, the very large aperture creates a great looking bokeh.Highly recommend picking up this lens!Read full review...",positive
8,"This is the best lens you can get for the price. It has great build quality and it gets the job done. I use this for video so I prefer hard stops on the focus ring, but other than that, I can't think of problems. It auto focuses quickly and the focus ring has a decent throw.Read full review...",positive
9,"This lens is great for video, specifically for getting a clear focal image with a slightly hazy background. Be sure to get the one that says STM because others will also say EF 50mm 1.8 then something else similar, and I almost ordered the wrong one before catching my error.Look for the STM or order this one. It's great! The filter lenses are an awesome bonus too. The box tells exactly what each is for if you're not sure.Read full review...",positive
10,"This is my first lens besides the kit lens and its exactly what I needed. The wider aperture allows the user to play around with the crisp depth of field. Yes, its not as convenient as a zoom lens but it does its job exceptionally well. Just use your feet to frame your shot!ProsQuick focusSharp Depth of Field/wide aperturePriceBuild QualityConsNo zoom (but you shouldn't expect that anyway)Overall I am very satisfied with this lens!Read full review...",positive
11,"It works perfectly with all of my cameras. I'm definitely going to buy two more now. This is a must-have for anyone seeking clear focus in still pictures or indie filmmaking. This has wonderful depth of field, and adds serious quality to your arsenal of lenses.Read full review...",positive
12,"I got my lens yesterday and right away tried it out. It produces beautiful bokeh at f/1.8! It's well made, and relatively quiet. Nice focus ring for manual focus. Was going to get the cheap Chinese knock off, but after seeing a video review of both lenses, the Canon blows the knock off away. Very happy with the lens so far.Read full review...",positive
13,"The 50mm 1.8 STM lens is a great step up from 18-55 kit lens (I own a Canon t5i). Depending on what mode you're shooting in for videos will determine if you hear then lens focusing or not, but it's barely visible. Unless your DSLR is wifi compatible, it may be difficult to take your own portraits, so invest in a 5-10ft shutter remote, or a wireless one.Read full review...",positive
14,This lens is extremely smooth on the focusing. It feels a lot better than the old canon 1.8 lens. Image quality is excellent. I'm using it on my Canon 77D and I love it.,positive
15,"I would say this is a tad sharper than the ii wide open, but I'm getting more keepers out of this lens compared to the old one due to it's auto-focus being a big step up. Overall, I really love this lens with it's better build quality, but why Canon doesn't put instant manual focus override in this lens boggles me...Read full review...",positive
16,Bought these lens because I wanted to do some portrait photography and wanted my pics to come out where the background is out of focus and these lens do just that! Arrived new and works just like it should. It focuses very quick and is pretty accurate with focusing. Focuses right where I want it to focus. Really love the f1.8 and the effect it creates with portraits. Excellent lens!Read full review...,positive
17,"This lens is classic.  Really durable construction and the autofocus is much improved over the original.  Its a bit heavier than the original, but if you don't have one of these I'd suggest getting one.  On a crop-sensor (APSC) this is going to give you the equivalent of an 80mm focal length view. This is tighter than you might expect, but very useful for portraits and medium distance shots.Read full review...",positive
18,This lens takes really sharp photos and is just a really great overall lens for everyday photos.  The focus is fast and quiet and for the price you really can't beat it!  This a definite must for any photographer's bag.Read full review...,positive
19,"Super lightweight, and wonderful photos can be produced with this little lens! Extremely easy to get used to and wonderful depth of field. Perfect for any camera person who doesn't want to break the bank!Read full review...",positive
20,"I really am not an expert photographer that is for sure, but I have to say this nifty little lens really helps a novice like me get much better quality images. I like it for blurring the background, and works very well.I feel it is a good value for what I use it for, and I couldn't be happier I invested in this 50mm lense. If anyone takes pictures of finished I hope you can appreciate how difficult it can be to capture the depth and quality. I finished this shelf with the 5 color wood dye kit, sealed with light coat if poly, and snapped this pic.The lense really helped :)Thank you for a great deal!Read full review...",positive
21,"The lens seems sturdy, though I have not had it a long time. The STM stepper motor makes focus fast and silent. It is also small and lightweight. The only real downside I have found with this lens is image sharpness wide open. If at all possible, try to never use the lens at any opening larger than f2.8. At f1.8 image sharpness suffers greatly. It is not uncommon for lenses to need to be stopped down a stop or two from wide open for best sharpness, and that holds true with this lens. There are Canon L lenses which are sharp wide open, but they cost hundreds, to thousands, of dollars. This lens is not in that same league. It does give very good performance though, just remember to not use it wide open. By the way, my results are based on the lens use with a Canon 5D MkII body, (full frame). Results may vary on a crop sensor body.Read full review...",positive
22,"For a hundred bucks this lens is a steal.   Image is very sharp, focus is good and the aperture is wide enough it works well in low light.",positive
23,"Brought this lens for my Canon 80D and it does not disappoint ! Canon has given their standard 50mm an ultimate update with their new STM lens motor ... and this lens works both for APS-C sensors and full frame making it a versatile value ! Lightweight and plastic, we know, but we all appreciate less weight after a day of shooting ! great go to lens when one wants to just set the camera on A or P to hand the camera off to a non pro who wants to see what digital is all about.  Canon is still the best value for me after 40 years of SLR film and now DSLR era cameras !Read full review...",positive
24,"Exactly what I was looking for. Gives me the depth of field I needed to get the effects I wanted (bokeh, blurred backgrounds) that I can't get with my other lenses. Focusing ring works smoothly, images are sharpRead full review...",positive
25,"I haven't used it much, but honestly, I can say that this lens is very good for the price. It does amazing portraits and the images are quite sharp and clear. It is a must have. I give it 4 stars only because the pictures have more noises in them than my other lens, but other than that, it's great!Read full review...",positive
26,"The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens is a fantastic value for the money! Good build quality, sharp image quality, great narrow depth of field for portraits etc., also a good macro lens used with macro tubes. A real winner!Read full review...",positive
27,"I had my doubts about the quality of this lens, but it has taken great photos in low light conditions and in taking close up pictures. I'm glad I read all the reviews, a great lens for the money.",positive
28,"I bought this lens because every review said that it was better than EF 50mm f/1.8 II. However, my comparison of the two lenses have indicated that STM version is not so much better than the previous lens. It tends to bring out blue in dark light, while under the same condition EF II version brings out more yellow. When wide open, both lenses show soft corners. My extreme crops from both Canon 5D gen 1 and 6D turn out to be painted pictures instead of photographs whereas pictures taken with Fuji X-T10 with 35mm f/1.8 shows more details, tonal quality and truly photographic looks with more dynamic range well and beautifully controlled.  Compared to Fuji X-T10, both gen 1 5D and 6D images are like toy cameras, and I am planning to sell both of them in the near future.  Once stopped down to f/5.6 and higher, Canon images become sharp corner to corner, but when wide open Fuji 35mm f/1.8 out perform Canon's poorly designed cheap lenses.Read full review...",positive
29,Super sharp. Smooth Bokeh. Great value. I have to get used to the thin focal plane compared to f/2.8,positive
30,"Comparing it to the standard 18 - 55 that came with my SL2 it is sharper and more consistent in actual color of subject. Although the fixed lens took some shots to find a sweet spot on distance it is versatile in both close up and wide angles. My portrait photos look amazing when using the larger f stop 1.8 and my macro shots too! My old lens is now in a bag stored away. Would prefer to carry 2 primes 24mm & this 50mm along with my zoom 70 - 300. I really like this lens...great price, great pics.Read full review...",positive
31,"I am new to photography. When buying a camera the kit lens your receive as part of your package often try to accomplish many different things. In the end, never seem to do a great job of any specific thing.The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 Lens is the perfect lens to snap a  portrait. While it is motorized and does a nice job of zeroing-in on your subject. I prefer to go manul and snap the picture I want to see. I now find myself reaching for the 50mm lense to snap a quick photo when walking down a crowed street or a quick pic of my gal.The lens is light and you hardly feel it's weight. It attaches easily to the camera body. Just line up the red dot on the lens with the red dot on the camera body. And you are ready to go!Enjoy!!Read full review...",positive
32,"If photography is a hobby or if you have a decent camera and want to take your own photos to hang up around the house, this is a great lens. I have the Canon Rebel T6i and it works great when taking that close up photo of a flower or a person while blurring out the background. If you don't want to spend an excessive amount of money for a lens, I would definitely recommend this one.Read full review...",positive
33,Perfect for portraits. I love using manual focus and you can greatly control how much of the background and how sharp you want the subject to be.,positive

38,I absolutely love this lens!! The focus is soft to adjust and I love how the back ground is blurry from my model.,positive

It's simply a great lens and makes taking the camera to birthdays and gatherings apleasure. Everyone is impressed by the images coming from our Canon T6.Read full review...,positive
44,"For a 50mm lens, I don't think there's a need to buy anything more expensive than this. The truth is the optics in 50mm lenses are a lot simpler than in wide-angle lenses, and even cheap one like this one can provide ultimate quality. If you've got some decent cash to put into expensive lenses, get wide-angle ones. Good wide-angle lenses don't come cheap. For for a 50, all you need is the good'ol Nifty Fifty!Read full review...",positive
45,"If your starting out in photography, money is an issue and your on the fence between this and the 50mm 1.4, which is at least 200 bucks higher, I'd get this one. I've owned them both and the new STM 50 1.8 is really good, very close in sharpness and Bokeh. Plus, it's not much more than 100 bucks, something you can pass on to a friend or your kid when they become a new photographer. It's a win win. Read full review...",positive

55,"This lens is great very sharp, focuses extremely quick and quietly which is great for video. I have to say it provides even better Bokeh as compare to the 50mm EF non STM counterpart. So I would say it has even better portrait capabilities and for around the same price I highly recommend this purchase.Read full review...",positive
